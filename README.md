# QMK_KeymapToAsciiTable
Python script, that get input from keymap.c and returns "comments.txt." "comments.txt" contains searched layers, and commented ascii table for each layer(s).


# How to use?
1. put the script file in the same path where your keymap.c file is.
2. execute the script, it will generate file called `comment.txt` and `KeyboardLayout.json`.
3. If you are using plane Ortho-linear keyboard, You can just open `comment.txt`, and copy the result.
4. If you are not Ortho-linear keyboard user and wish to custommize keysizes you can do followings:

    1. Open the `KeyboardLayout.json` file that have been generated by first time you execute the script.
    2. Type in you keyboard configurations, the keysizes. For example, If you 1st row's first key is 2u, you should fine a part startes with `"0" : ` and change the first Item to 2. Remeber that the first row / key is always 0 not 1. One thing to keep in mind: this script does not support decimals for the `KeyboardLyout.json`. You should only use integers in it.
    3. Re-run the script, check the re generated `comment.txt`.
